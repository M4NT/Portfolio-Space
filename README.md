# Portfolio-Space

  I'm developing my Portfolio inspired by the Space theme, where I intend to apply HTML, CSS, JS and some new functions to learn even more about frontend and backend. In addition, I decided to create it based on a report, where you can follow my evolutionary process.


_______# Day 1 #_______

  I'm basing on some code from other people that I'd like to thank you for making it available through Codepen, like @Lan Chang, @sarazond and a few other people I will add over time to help me on this journey. But for now, that's all I have. I was able to add @sarazond's "Parallax Star Background" and @Lan Chang's "Card animation". I tried putting a zero gravity effect on the card to make it look like it was actually floating through space and in the background I wanted the stars to keep rising to make it look like it was always evolving. I'm really loving it and I want to do new projects exploring this theme. My next plans are to fix some bugs I'm finding, like for example when the card stops floating and I hover over it, it appears very fast, breaking the zero gravity effect I wanted to introduce. Also, when I refresh the page, the RGBA light background that there is in "Parallax..." goes up and a "quick" solution I found for this is just closing and opening the page again to go back to where it was. I still want to add a loading effect when entering it, but I'm out of ideas for now.
  
  Update:
- Cards with animation
- Background with rising stars

  Note:
Please don't mind how I'm organizing my files for now. I'm still learning and to make it easier, I'm naming them my way to find them later. :smile:
